# Express Server Boilerplate

## Introduction
Welcome to the Express Server Boilerplate! This is a simple and ready-to-use template for kickstarting your web application using the Express.js framework. Whether you're building a RESTful API, a web application, or a backend service, this boilerplate provides you with a solid foundation to get started quickly.

## Features

- **Express.js**: A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **MVC Architecture**: Organize your code using the Model-View-Controller pattern for maintainability and scalability.
- **Routing**: Basic routing setup for handling different endpoints and HTTP methods.
- **Middleware**: Includes example middleware for logging, error handling, and more.
- **Configuration**: Environment variables and configuration setup using the dotenv package.
- **JSON Responses**: JSON as the default response format for API endpoints.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling and custom error classes for better control.
- **Logging**: Integration with a logging library for capturing application logs.
- **Linting**: Pre-configured ESLint setup for code linting and formatting.
- **Testing**: Basic testing setup using a testing framework (e.g., Mocha) and assertion library (e.g., Chai).
- **Docker**: Dockerfile included for containerization.
- **Security**: Includes basic security practices like `helmet` for HTTP headers and input validation.
- **Gitignore**: Commonly ignored files and directories are already set up.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (>=14.x)
- npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Clumsynite/express-server-boilerplate.git
    ```


2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd express-server-boilerplate
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

4. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and customize the environment variables as needed.

5. Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

Your Express server should now be up and running at http://localhost:5001.


## Usage

- Create your **\`routes\`** in the routes directory following the existing examples.
- Organize your controllers and business logic in the **\`controllers\`** directory.
- Store your data models in the **\`models\`** directory.
- Customize error handling in the **\`middlewares/errorHandler.js\`** file.
- Add your application-specific middleware in the **\`middlewares\`** directory.
- Write **\`tests\`** in the test directory using the testing framework of your choice.


## Testing

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will trigger the testing framework to execute the tests located in the test directory.

## Docker

If you want to containerize your application using Docker, a Dockerfile is provided. You can build the Docker image using the following commands:

```bash
docker build -t my-express-app .
```

And then run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 5001:5001 --env-file ./.env -d my-express-app
```
